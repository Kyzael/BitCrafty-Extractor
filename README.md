# BitCrafty-Extractor

## Overview

The BitCrafty-Extractor is a revolutionary AI-powered computer vision tool designed to extract game data from Bitcraft with unprecedented accuracy. Unlike traditional OCR approaches that struggle with game UI text (achieving only 60-80% accuracy), this tool leverages state-of-the-art AI vision models like GPT-4 Vision and Claude 3 to achieve 95%+ accuracy in data extraction.

The main application features a sophisticated three-pane console interface with global hotkeys that work seamlessly while playing BitCraft.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run the main BitCrafty-Extractor application (recommended)
bitcrafty-extractor

# Alternative methods
python bitcrafty-extractor.py
python -m bitcrafty_extractor

# The three-pane interface will launch with:
# Left: Hotkey controls and session statistics
# Right: Live screenshot queue status  
# Bottom: Real-time debug log
```

### Global Hotkeys (Work while playing BitCraft!)
- **📸 Ctrl+Shift+E**: Take screenshot and add to queue
- **🤖 Ctrl+Shift+X**: Analyze entire screenshot queue with AI
- **🚪 Ctrl+Shift+Q**: Quit application gracefully

## Key Features

   - Press **Ctrl+Shift+E** for each screenshot you want to capture
   - Visual/audio feedback confirms each screenshot is queued
   - Queue as many screenshots as needed (items, crafts, tooltips, etc.)

2. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Press **Ctrl+Shift+X** to analyze the entire queue
   - AI processes all screenshots together
   - Automatically identifies items and crafts from the images
   - Returns complete structured data for everything found

3. **Output**: 
   - All items and crafts extracted in a single response
   - Clear organization with confidence scores
   - Queue automatically clears after successful analysis

### Manual Extraction
The console interface displays all extraction data in real-time:
- Screenshots are queued automatically when using hotkeys
- Analysis results appear in the console interface immediately
- Session statistics track your extraction progress
- Debug panel shows all system operations

## Data Integration

The extracted data is designed to integrate with the main [BitCrafty](https://github.com/Kyzael/BitCrafty) application:

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Game window not found"**
- Ensure Bitcraft is running and visible
- Check window name in capture configuration
- Try running as administrator

**"API key not working"**
- Verify API key is correct and has credits
- Check provider configuration in settings
- Ensure internet connection is stable

**"Hotkeys not responding"**
- Check if another application is using the same hotkeys
- Try different key combinations
- Ensure hotkeys are enabled in the application

**"Low confidence scores"**
- Ensure game UI is clearly visible and not obscured
- Try extracting during stable game states
- Check image quality settings

**"Queue not working"**
- Check that screenshots are being queued (visual feedback should confirm)
- Ensure queue isn't full (default max: 20 screenshots)
- Try clearing queue and starting fresh

**"No items/crafts found"**
- Ensure screenshots contain clear item tooltips or craft interfaces
- Check that UI elements are not cut off or partially obscured
- Verify screenshots show the relevant game data

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting `log_level: "DEBUG"` in the configuration file.
